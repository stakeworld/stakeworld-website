:::tip
Nominating validators (staking) is the process of using you kusama or polkadot assets for the stability of network for which you get rewarded by the network. There is a small risk if a validator misbehaves so it is important to choose a reliable validator, like STAKEWORLD
:::

You can stake your assets bij going to [polkadot.js.org](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/staking/targets?filter=stakeworld) and select the validators of your choosing. 
 
There is a lot of information on [the polkadot wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-nominate-polkadot) or you can watch the following video:
