# Thousand validator resources
The [Thousand Validator Program](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/thousand-validators) alias "1kv" is a way for new validators to become active by backing of the Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies by using their funds to nominate selected validators. There is an 1kv backend which arranges the scoring and nominations, the information is presented in "endpoints". It is a changing system in which sometimes new endpoint or scores are introduced. To extract and display these score's there are various overviews build by various kusama/polkadot enthousiasts, which sometimes give a better overview then the original website. Below some of these resources:
